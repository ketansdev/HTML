# HTML Practice Repository

This repository contains all my HTML practice exercises, projects, and experiments.  
It is intended for learning, improving, and experimenting with HTML concepts, including:

- Basic HTML structure and elements
- Forms, tables, and lists
- Semantic HTML
- Multimedia embedding (images, audio, video)
- Links, buttons, and navigation
- HTML best practices and accessibility

I will be updating this repository regularly as I continue to learn and explore more HTML features.
